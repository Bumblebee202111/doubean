=======

An unofficial [Douban][douban] app mainly used for browsing the [Groups][douban-groups] section.
\([Ë±ÜÁì£][douban]ÈùûÂÆòÊñπappÔºå‰∏ªË¶ÅÁî®‰∫é[Â∞èÁªÑ][douban-groups]ÊµèËßà„ÄÇ\)

From now on, this repo will not be updated frequently as I am getting tired and bored of its
development as the app grows larger. Note I am an inexperienced beginner and the only developer of
it. Occasional crashes may happen, UI design may be incomplete and features you need may be missing.
Pretty much of my work is copy and paste from the official documentation and samples of Google
Android. I am trying my best only to ensure that the app will function normally on my Xiaomi devices
with Android version varying from 8.1 to 12.

### Getting Started

This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
`gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

#### Douban access

To not get myself into trouble, I have added detailed implementation of accessing data to .gitignore
list. However, the latest release is always available.

### Who is it for?

* Me and other developers who are learning Android, Java and version control
* Me and other users who want easier access to Douban groups

### Non-Goals

* Login-based features
* Kotlin
* Dagger2/Hilt
* RxAndroid
* Heavy use of Material Design

### Features

It not only implements the very basic features of Douban app, but also has its own features, some of
which react to the trend of Douban community to being unfriendly and closed to non-members. Examples
are abuse of power, "apply to follow or to talk" and etc.

* Inherent advantages leading to good performance and simple coding | Design Aspect | Choice\(s\) |
  | --- | --- | | Language | Java | | Libraries | Jetpack and authoritative third party libraries |
  | Architecture | MVVM | | Design philosophy | Android Jetpack |
* Support for viewing content in Douban WebView optimized for mobile reading
* Support for loading cache as alternative when connection is off
* Bilingual support for UI strings
* Ad-free, lite \(~30MB\)
* Support URL deep links
* Basic support for dark theme and tablets/landscape
* Basic paging support
* Support creating categories consisting of group/tab/search posts by multiple user-defined
  conditions \(TODO\)
